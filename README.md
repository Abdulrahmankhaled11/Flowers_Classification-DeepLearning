## Flowers Classification | CNN & MobilNet

###  Classification for flowers Images Using Deep learning üíê

- #### developed Convolutional Neural Network [CNN] especially because it gives high performance with Images and gived [0.73] model performance because the low number of data

 ### So , I used Transfer Leaning to achieve high performance .

- #### I used MobilNet model developed by Google and it achieved high performance compared to CNN
